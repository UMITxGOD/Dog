  "content": "The Afghan Hound is elegance personified. This unique, ancient dog breed has an appearance quite unlike any other: dramatic silky coat, exotic face, and thin, fashion-model build. Looks aside, Afghan enthusiasts describe this hound as both aloof and comical. Hailing from Afghanistan, where the original name for the breed was Tazi, the Afghan is thought to date back to the pre-Christian era and is considered one of the oldest dog breeds. Although theyâ€™re purebred dogs, you may find Afghan Hounds in shelters or in the care of rescue groups. If this is the breed for you, opt to adopt if possible!",
